This project is a set of procedures to populate the Alliance Individualized Dashboard Sharepoint Websites.

The principle components are:

	1. Alliance Enrolled Membership Roster
	2. Alliance Inpatient Census
	3. VBP Quality Roster
	4. Alliance Health Information Exchange Tool
	
	The process should work like this:
	
	1.  Alliance Member Roster
	  a.  The code for this is in the Intranet project
	  b.  By nature, it provides a roster of everyone who is or has been enrolled with the Allliance, by all of thier respective enrollment segments.
	  c. This code simplifies this to only the most recent enrollment segment
	  d. The code for this is develped in the Community Health Outreach Roster, and any updates to the main code should be made there first.
	  e.  The R program then distributes the data to each Alliance Provider's Aid site folder
	  
	2.  Alliance Inpatient Census
	  a.  Currently, the data is queried directly in SQL Management Studio from HCA data warehouse
	    1.  Cases that are currentl inpatient are first querried
	    2.  Cases that were admitted AND discharged are querried next
	    3.  The results of these 2 queries are saved as .csv files in the "./projects/AllianceIntranetSupport/data/input" folder
	      a.  The files are "CensusInpatient.csv" and "CensusDischarge.csv"
    b.  Now in R Studio, combine the 2 files to create a single table that reports both admits and discharges, and
    c.  Attach information from the Alliance Member Enrollment data to provide outreach information
    d.  The R program then distributes the data to each Alliance Provider's Aid site folder
	    
  3.  HIE
    a.  Data for the last _________ days is queried from the HCA data warehouse using SQL
    b.  Write this data to CSV for the record
    b.  Attach information from the Alliance Member Enrollment data to provide outreach information
    c.  Filter the data for Alliance Members only who have or have had an enrollment with BCBSAZ HCA, keeping only thier most recent enrollment entry
    d.  The R program then distributes the data to each Alliance Provider's Aid site folder
	    
	    
  4.  Value Based Quality Roster Data
    a.  This data is created in the ValueBasedData project and saved as a .csv in "./projects/ValueBasedData/data/output"
      1.  The file is called "Data_VBPQR_AllRecords.csv"
    b.  Power automate runs everynight and copies the file from the "./projects/ValueBasedData/data/output" to "./projects/AllianceIntranetSupport/data/input"
    c.  This data comes in with All records since 2022
    d.  R code in the Intranet Support project then filters the data for only the most recent report, and then
    e.  Distributes the data for the most recent report data to each of the providers' Aid site folders
